Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
I decided to overload the constructors to create a default house, library, and cafe. This is so that even without a written description they would be able to represent something without throwing me an error. In each of the subclasses I also chose one method which includes a parameter and overload it by deleting the parameter and replacing so I would be able to have the default for those classes. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
What worked was understanding the code in the new building class. I would give the students the sugesstion of starting the assignments earlier as it would be easier that way.
